# Postmark Hooks

This project is a quick start app you can use to host your own URLs for receiving, storing, processing, and viewing webhooks sent from [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com). It is written in Meteor.js. Be sure to read the [Postmark webhooks documentation](http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-webhooks-overview.html). Use the deploy to Heroku button (you can host it somewhere else if you want, like [Galaxy](https://www.meteor.com/hosting)) and begin taking advantage of Postmark's [Open tracking webhook](http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-open-webhook.html), [Bounce webhook](http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-bounce-webhook.html), and [Inbound webhook](http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-inbound-webhook.html). Head [here](https://postmarkhooks.herokuapp.com/bounces) to play with a demo instance of the app. Note that the demo app for you to play around with before deploying is highly ephemeral and only meant for quick tests. Data is removed often to ensure a clean playground for anyone who wants to try it out.

## Features

- Receive webhook POSTs (well formatted JSON) from Postmark for Bounces, Opens, and Inbound messages, with minimal development/configuration effort on your part
- Automatically send emails (using Postmark) to yourself and/or others when you receive a new bounce, open, or inbound message
- Searchable so you can easily find and view details of a specific bounce, open event, or inbound message

## Prerequisites

- Sign Up for Heroku [here](https://signup.heroku.com)

## Getting Started

- Use the Deploy to Heroku button at the top of this page to quickly host your own instance of the app. 
- Be sure to add a custom name for the app, rather than use one generated by Heroku:

- Use the custom name to enter in your ROOT_URL for the Heroku app:

- Once you have entered in your custom name and ROOT_URL, you can proceed to deploy the app to Heroku by clicking Deploy for Free. Once completed, click View to open your new app on the web.

## Configure Postmark Account

Our next step is to set the new URLs we have available as your settings for your Postmark webhooks. Setting these URLs tells Postmark where to send the webhook messages. URLs for the webhooks are in the following format:

- https://yourname.herokuapp.com/webhooks/bounces
- https://yourname.herokuapp.com/webhooks/opens
- https://yourname.herokuapp.com/webhooks/inbound

If you prefer to use an existing Postmark account you have for sending email notifications, you can remove the Postmark plugin that was added to the app during deployment. Otherwise, access your Postmark in Heroku:

## Set Inbound URL

## Included Heroku Add-Ons

Deploying to Heroku sets you up with a Postmark account for sending email notifications from the app that includes 10,000 free emails per month. Additional credits can be purchased as necessary and do not expire. You will also receive an [mLab MongoDB](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab) with their free sandbox plan. You can upgrade your mLab MongoDB plan in Heroku if you need additional storage. Upgrade your mLab MongoDB plan if you plan to use this heavily in production as their sandbox instances do not include redundancy for their databases.

## Built With

* [Atom](https://atom.io)
* [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com)
* [Postmark.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postmark)

## Security

- Only [Postmark's listed IPs](http://support.postmarkapp.com/article/800-ips-for-firewalls) for webhooks can POST to URLs built by this app. Any other received request is ignored and no document is added to the collections in the database.
- Received data is also validated against a schema to ensure appropriate data received and stored as a document in its associated collection.
- Insecure removed so the database cannot be accessed from the client (browser dev tools)
- Option to receive emails if an unauthorized source attempts to post to your URL

## Customize Your Notification Settings

This app allows for you to send emails using Postmark when you receive a bounce, open event, or inbound message. Open up server/settings.js to view and modify the settings. Use the Server API Token for the Server you wish to send notifications from in Postmark (found in Credentials when viewing the server in Postmark). You can send emails based on the following events:

* Bounce received
* Inbound Message received
* Open Event received
* Unauthorized (not from Postmark's IP addresses) POST received to one of your webhook URLs

By default, notifications will be sent for all events unless you disable them by changing their value to ``false``. Sending notifications for events can be turned on/off for each of these event types by changing these fields to true/false:

* ``SendBouncesNotifications`` (for bounces)
* ``SendOpensNotifications`` (for open events)
* ``SendInboundNotifications`` (for inbound messages)
* ``SendViolationsNotifications`` (for unauthorized POSTs to your URLs)
```javascript
{
  "ServerAPIToken": "YourServerAPIToken",
  "SendBouncesNotifications": false,
  "SendOpensNotifications": false,
  "SendInboundNotifications": false,
  "SendViolationsNotifications": false,
  "BouncesFromEmailAddress": "yourbouncesnotificationemail@yourdomain.com",
  "OpensFromEmailAddress": "youropensnotificationemail@yourdomain.com",
  "InboundFromEmailAddress": "yourinboundnotificationsemail@yourdomain",
  "BouncesToEmailAddress": "pmnotifications+bounces@yourdomain.com",
  "OpensToEmailAddress": "pmnotifications+opens@yourdomain.com",
  "InboundToEmailAddress": "pmnotifications+inbound@yourdomain.com",
  "ViolationsFromEmailAddress": "pmhooksviolations@yourdomain.com",
  "ViolationsToEmailAddress": "pmnotifications+violations@yourdomain.com"
}
```

Set the From email addresses for your notifications to email addresses that you have added as Sender Signatures in Postmark to be sure you are able to send notification emails. These notification emails can be sent to any recipient.
